# Sev
Sev is a Browser extension used to store links with a preview.

> **Development Note:** To obtain a preview of the link, I've utilized `link-preview-js`, a Node.js module. Since Node modules can't be directly used in extension development, I've employed Browserify to make the `link-preview-js` module compatible with the browser.
